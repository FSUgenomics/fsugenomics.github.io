The Translational Science Laboratory (College of Medicine) and The Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine will be holding Proteomics/Genomics joint interest group meetings on second Monday of each month at 11:30 AM. We intend to conduct seminars, workshops and technical discussions related to proteome, metabolome and genome analysis. The first introductory meeting will be held on February 8, 2016 where we intend to provide an overview of the facilities and services available to FSU researchers.
