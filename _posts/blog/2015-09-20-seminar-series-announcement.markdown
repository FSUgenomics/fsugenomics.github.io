The Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine is planning to hold a monthly seminar series beginning in the Spring of 2016. The seminar series will feature presentations related to genomics research given by researchers at FSU. Those interested in attending are encouraged to send days of the month and times that conflict with their schedules. Researchers engaged in genomics research and are interested in giving a presentation are encouraged to [email Daniel Vera](mailto:vera@genomics.fsu.edu).
