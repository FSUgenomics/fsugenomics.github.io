The National Science Foundation has awarded a $2.1 million grant to a team of researchers at Florida State University and Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University to study the maize genome. The project is led by FSU Associate Professor of Biological Science Hank Bass, who has teamed up with FSU Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine Director Daniel Vera, FSU Associate Professor of Biological Science Jonathan Dennis, FSU Associate Professor of Statistics Jinfeng Zhang, FAMU Professor of Viticulture and Developmental Biology Violeta Tsolova, and FAMU Professor of Agronomy Oghenekome Onokpise.

The goal of this project is to develop a genome-wide map of chromatin accessibility as a foundational resource for the integration of other maize genomic data sets across many different projects. This project builds on a breakthroughs from the previous NSF-funded project on characterizing the chromatin landscape in the maize genome. Five diverse tissues of maize will be profiled to produce high-quality epigenomic reference maps. Annual workshops will provide participants from FSU and other institutions with new genome research data and expertise for their own research programs.
