# The application process

For some research projects, we provide free assistance with the preparation of grant proposals, including:

- Hypothesis generation
- Experimental design
- Data analysis and the generation of preliminary data
- Due to limited personnel resources for such activities, these services are provided based on merit and on a competitive, project-by-project basis. Investigators interested in receiving free assistance in the preparation of grant proposals must apply for these services. Applications will be reviewed by the CGPM Steering Committee. We may request modifications to proposals (e.g., requests for more information or clarifications). Applications will be reviewed using the following criteria:

Feasibility and Fundability.
Services requested for the preparation of the grant proposal.
Services requested for the grant proposal activities.
The amount of time until the grant proposal deadline date.
If fee-for-service more appropriate.


## Instructions for applying for services

In order to apply for assistance in the preparation of grant proposals, investigators should prepare a short proposal to CGPM detailing the proposed activities, and should include the information listed below.
