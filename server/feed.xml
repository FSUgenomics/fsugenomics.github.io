        <title>Blog: Genomics and Proteomics seminar series to begin in February 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Translational Science Laboratory (College of Medicine) and The Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine will be holding Proteomics/Genomics joint interest group meetings on second Monday of each month at 11:30 AM. We intend to conduct seminars, workshops and technical discussions related to proteome, metabolome and genome analysis. The first introductory meeting will be held on February 8, 2016 where we intend to provide an overview of the facilities and services available to FSU researchers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proteomics/Genomics Joint Interest Group Meeting&lt;br /&gt;
Location: Room 1302, College of Medicine&lt;br /&gt;
Time: 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;
Schedule: Second Monday of each month &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog: Genomics seminar series to start in Spring of 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine is planning to hold a monthly seminar series beginning in the Spring of 2016. The seminar series will feature presentations related to genomics research given by researchers at FSU. Those interested in attending are encouraged to send days of the month and times that conflict with their schedules. Researchers engaged in genomics research and are interested in giving a presentation are encouraged to &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#097;&amp;#064;&amp;#103;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#105;&amp;#099;&amp;#115;&amp;#046;&amp;#102;&amp;#115;&amp;#117;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;email Daniel Vera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog: FSU concludes a two-week plant chromatin workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today concluded a two-week workshop hosted by FSU Associate Professor of Biological Science Hank Bass and The Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine Director Daniel Vera. The workshop was part of an outreach activity for their &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/nsf-award/&quot;&gt;recently awarded NSF grant&lt;/a&gt; and was attended by researchers from Cornell University, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Donald Danforth Plant Sciences Center, and Florida State University. Attendees were trained to perform a new technique developed by Bass and Vera for studying how DNA is organized and regulated in plant cells. Workshops are planned to take place every year for the duration of the 4-year grant, and the next workshop is expected to take place during the summer of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog: NSF plant genome grant awarded to FSU</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The National Science Foundation has awarded a $2.1 million grant to a team of researchers at Florida State University and Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University to study the maize genome. The project is led by FSU Associate Professor of Biological Science Hank Bass, who has teamed up with FSU Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine Director Daniel Vera, FSU Associate Professor of Biological Science Jonathan Dennis, FSU Associate Professor of Statistics Jinfeng Zhang, FAMU Professor of Viticulture and Developmental Biology Violeta Tsolova, and FAMU Professor of Agronomy Oghenekome Onokpise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a genome-wide map of chromatin accessibility as a foundational resource for the integration of other maize genomic data sets across many different projects. This project builds on a breakthroughs from the previous NSF-funded project on characterizing the chromatin landscape in the maize genome. Five diverse tissues of maize will be profiled to produce high-quality epigenomic reference maps. Annual workshops will provide participants from FSU and other institutions with new genome research data and expertise for their own research programs.&lt;/p&gt;
