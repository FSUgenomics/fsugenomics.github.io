## Sequencing and characterization of the gopher tortoise genome
![Gopher Tortoise - source: commons.wikimedia.org](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Florida_Gopher_Tortoise.jpg/800px-Florida_Gopher_Tortoise.jpg)  
The gopher tortoise is native to the United States and is an important species in pine savannas that are abundant in the southeastern US. The gopher tortoise is named for it's burrowing behavior. It digs long and deep burrows for shelter, where it is protected from the predators and extreme temperatures. The gopher tortoise is classified as a "Threatened" species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service because of habitat loss, automobile encounters, and predation by humans. The FSU Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine launched a crowdsourcing campaign through [sparkFSU](https://spark.fsu.edu/) to raise funds to sequence and characterize the genomes of the gopher tortoise and other threatened or endangered Florida species. The sequencing and characterization of genomes for the purpose of assisting conservation efforts, also known as "conservation genomics", provides molecular signatures that can be utilized to characterize gopher tortoise population dynamics over time. In addition, genome sequences can provide insights into the unique biological characteristics of the gopher tortoise. This project provides research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at FSU who are learning to perform whole-genome sequencing from start to finish.

## Origin and significance of altered replication timing in pediatric leukemia

B-lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy, yet we still do not understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to the genesis of this disease and there are no known strategies for its prevention. Pediatric B-ALL cells deviate from non-leukemic human B cells in the temporal order in which segments of their chromosomal DNA are duplicated (replication timing; RT). In collaboration with the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), we are generating genome-wide RT profiles from a large cohort of banked pediatric B-ALL samples lacking prognostic markers and developing statistical linkages to outcome to potentially identify a whole new genre of biomarkers for pediatric leukemia; 2) We are profiling the changes in RT that accompany the process by which normal human B-cells are generated to determine which RT alterations in leukemia derive from the cell type of origin; 3) We are developing a novel model of leukemic transformation of normal human hematopoietic cells to assess when and in what cell types evidence of “aberrant RT” first appears during the process of leukemogenesis. RT has the potential to provide a new genre of biomarkers for diagnosis. In addition, RT reports on an undeveloped aspect of chromosome biology that is altered in B-ALL. Hence, studies of the cellular origin and mechanistic determinants of these RT alterations will provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of B-ALL.

## Nuclease Profiling as an Integrative Resource for Maize Epigenomics

The eukaryotic nuclear genome is organized into nucleosomes which are segments of DNA that are wrapped around sets of proteins called histone octamers. Nucleosomes regulate the access of proteins to DNA, and thus can influence DNA-templated events such as transcription, DNA repair, DNA replication, and recombination. Nucleosomes regulate and respond to various nuclear processes through their position, modifications, and remodeling. The distribution of nucleosomes can be determined with micrococcal nuclease (MNase), an enzyme that preferentially cleaves the DNA between nucleosomes. This property allows for preparative recovery and measurement of nucleosome-protected sequences genome-wide using technologies such as DNA microarrays.

## Chromatin structural changes linking drugs of abuse with HIV reactivation

Drug abuse and addiction add a significant challenging dimension to our comprehension of the progression and treatment of HIV/AIDS. A promising class of HIV treatments (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors, HDIs) and psychostimulant drugs of abuse share a common denominator: both cause changes in chromatin structure through the acetylation of histones. Our goal is to identify and analyze the functional chromatin regulatory networks associated with HDIs and psychostimulant treatment by Identifying HDI- and psychostimulant-induced chromatin and gene regulatory changes, and define the role of HDI- and psychostimulant-induced chromatin structural changes in complex genetic and epigenetic regulatory networks.
